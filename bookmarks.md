## Bookmarks and Stuff

Here are things that I didn't invent, but I find myself constantly referring back to.

### A 'local' `.gitignore`

Sometimes you want to ignore files and not push them to VSC but also don't want `git` to even possibly consider it. To do this, you can update `.git/info/exclude`

### `uv` Script Mode

See [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#creating-a-python-script)

`uv` now supports script mode. This is quite amazing for one-off scripts rather than publishing and overloading pypi, you can just share a single script and `uv` will correctly pull depdencies (reminds me of [flit](https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/)). 

**Usage**

Start by using `--script` mode

```sh
uv init --script example.py --python 3.12
```

Then you can add dependencies. This will update the `example.py` with the appropriate header

```sh
uv add --script example.py 'requests<3' 'rich'
```

If one then follows up by adding the shebang

```py
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
```

So that the resulting file looks something like

```py
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests<3",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint
...
```

Then the script will be completely runnable as a normal `cli` command!

Unfortunately using it interactively isn't so straightforward. Though a recipe like:

```sh
$ "$(uv python find --script script.py)"
>>> from script import X
```

Should work

### Architecture Decision Record

My go-to template is the [Alexandrian Pattern]([https://github.com/jamesmh/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_for_alexandrian_pattern.md](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-for-alexandrian-pattern)), which is based on [Design Pattern from Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern)

#### Introduction

* Prologue (Summary)
* Discussion (Context)
* Solution (Decision)
* Consequences (Results)

#### Specifics

      facing (concern)<br>

      to achieve (quality)<br>
      accepting (downside).
* Discussion (Context)
  * Explains the forces at play (technical, political, social, project).
  * This is the story explaining the problem we are looking to resolve.

### HTML Template

[Pico](https://picocss.com/) has proven to me to be a good enough HTML template with sensible defaults. It can be classless if you want it to be, or you can have some extras on top. 

It provides you with a good starter template.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css"
    >
    <title>Hello world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main class="container">
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

Color scheme overrides can be done just by adding an attribute to the html tag, e.g. `<html data-theme="light">`.

### Organising Stuff

I keep coming back to [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/). It has been great for personal, admin things - though I haven't used it for work or programming related projects. On that front still seeing if I can do better. This blog site "setup" (or lack thereof) has definitely been influenced by Johnny Decimal.
