### Architecture Decision Record

My go-to template is the [Alexandrian Pattern]([https://github.com/jamesmh/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_for_alexandrian_pattern.md](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-for-alexandrian-pattern)), which is based on [Design Pattern from Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern)
