## Dependency Injection via SQLModels isn't worth it

_February 2025_

It's been something I've been mulling over for a while now. I'm not convinced using `Session` with [Dependency Injection is worth it](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/session-with-dependency/?h=depend). The abstraction is nice, visually, but the lack of context makes things really hard to reason with, especially if you're doing something beyond a simple getter/setter. This happens if you're building an application that performs a flow or some business logic rather than a pure CRUD, then you may need to do multiple commits in a single query which may _not_ need to all be rolled back. This of course breaks some kind of assumption to do with "a single unit of work". 

I encountered this in one of the more painful ways, and instead reverted back to how the `sqlalchemy` orm does it. With that in mind, I thought this is a quick note to remind myself to beware, think and plan things out better, because I undoubtedly will try something stupid like this again. 

Using `sqlalchemy`:

```py
from contextlib import contextmanager

from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlmodel import Session as SQLModelSession
from sqlmodel import create_engine

engine = create_engine(...)
SessionDB = sessionmaker(class_=SQLModelSession, autoflush=False, bind=engine)


def get_session():
    return SessionDB(bind=engine, expire_on_commit=False)


@contextmanager
def session_scope():
    session = get_session()
    try:
        yield session
        session.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        raise e
    finally:
        session.close()
```

Then the corresponding usage is the very natural:

```py
from sqlmodel import col, select

with session_scope() as session:
    # do stuff here...for example
    statement = (
        select(MyTable)
        .where(MyTable.column_name == value)
        .order_by(col(MyTable.column_name).desc())
    )
```
