## rqlite - a Production Experiment

_January 2025_

`rqlite` is a distributed version of sqlite using the raft consensus algorithm. The great thing about rqlite actually has nothing to do with the underlying tech, but more to do with broad developer experience and that is the defaults with the provided [helm charts](https://github.com/rqlite/helm-charts/tree/master). 

It just feels like I'm the target audience - someone who wants to quickly push `rqlite` to production with the minimal dependencies and gives me enough to shoot myself in the foot. Compared with `postgres` helm charts, `rqlite` presumes that you _may_ want to just use it as-is, without even a values file. That is a welcome change, whereas almost anything from the bitnami one expects you as a developer will make modifications. Something in that model does not _feel_ quite right. This friction (although seemingly trivial) converted me to use `rqlite` (the other reason is I was using `sqlite` for my tests which meant I didn't need to worry about changing any code to ensure compatibility between different sql dialects). 

This kind of DX is something which I will seek to replicate when/if I build my own libraries for wide consumption.
