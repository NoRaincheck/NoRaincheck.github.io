## Inlay Hints and LSPs

_June 2025_

It's currently 2025, and there is a massive amount of interest in LLM/AI powered IDEs. But I think there is something more powerful - making good use of your LSPs. In particular _inlay hints_. Now inlay hints are a somewhat recent addition, but its something that helps with inferring type hints or annotating your code with these hints to reduce mental strain. 

* Python: [pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/) adds support by default
* Rust: [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) adds support by default
* Go: [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls) adds support -- you may need to enable it in settings

In VSCode settings it would look like:

```json
{
  "go.inlayHints.assignVariableTypes": true,
  "go.inlayHints.compositeLiteralFields": true,
  "go.inlayHints.compositeLiteralTypes": true,
  "go.inlayHints.constantValues": true,
  "go.inlayHints.functionTypeParameters": true,
  "go.inlayHints.parameterNames": true,
  "go.inlayHints.rangeVariableTypes": true
}
```

On a related note about reducing mental load, I've learnt to embrace formatting and auto-fixing linting issues on save which has been amazing for ensuring some level of consistency and thinking less about style guides.
