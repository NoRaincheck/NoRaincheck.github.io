**Welcome to my blog**

A collection of thoughts - short essays, reflections, personal opinions\
A collection of experiments - 'vibe' coding, things that may not work, tests and things which maybe purposely imperfect
or incomplete\
A list of future projects - ideas and plans for the future, whatever may happen\
A list of things I use - mostly because I sometimes lose track of settings/configuration I have in my setup, as I have a
tendency to tinker with these things a lot\
A list of bookmarks - stuff I have a tendency of referring back to infrequently and sometimes lose track of it; things
mostly **not** written by me

Personal Mantra: I'm trying to simplify my headspace, and strip software development down to the essentials. Things are
too bloated nowadays and maybe, just by doing to minimal requirements well, we can return to a place where software is
sane, afterall despite all this amazing progress, why I can't I run modern software on my 15+ year old computer? Do I
really need 16gb RAM when I used to make do with < 2gb?
