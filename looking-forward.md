* Write janky games, using https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten with extensions https://github.com/SolarLune/Tetra3d
  *  For sprite-based games consider this tileset: https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii
  *  We can try [DALL-E 3 to TRELLIS](https://trellis3d.github.io/) pipeline with [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) for Animations with Blender to generate the spritesheets.
* Perform Chinese Word Segmentation on arbitary text for building an application to learn chinese better https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_word-segmented_writing (ex. package https://github.com/ckiplab/ckiptagger), with the idea that it can process things batch/offline and host a static version on a static website.
